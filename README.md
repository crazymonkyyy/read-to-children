#### pre alpha contributing

things I could use help with rn

1. porting my build scripts for raylib projects to windows
2. finding a (short) public domain audio book, and several wallpaper sized images you think match it (https://librivox.org/)
3. making an editing pass on my spec
4. demo generating a whole clothe video file with text rendering over images in d thats approachable( my current method is slow and terrible)
5. making a (github hosted?) website with fancy mission statement and other tropes of charity projects
